      The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement
      in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised
      architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids,
      concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further
      increases the aesthetic aspect. Not a piece of architecture, as other
      buildings are, but the proud passions of an emperorâ€™s love wrought in
      living stones.
